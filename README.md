'''StyleSage-AI
Where AI meets Elegence

StyleSage AI is an AI-powered multi-modal jewelry recommendation system that delivers personalized jewelry suggestions based on face shape, skin tone, neckline, and occasion. The system leverages deep learning, computer vision, and natural language processing (NLP) techniques to create accurate, contextually relevant recommendations tailored to user preferences.

Key Features
Personalized Recommendations: Suggests jewelry pieces based on a userâ€™s unique attributes, such as face shape, skin tone, neckline, and occasion.
Multi-Modal AI System: Combines deep learning models for computer vision (EfficientNet, ViT, ResNet-18) and NLP (RoBERTa) to extract meaningful insights from both images and text.
Custom Dataset: Uses a custom dataset to train the recommendation engine, providing suggestions for both traditional Indian jewelry and modern styles.
Transfer Learning: Utilizes pre-trained models, fine-tuned on fashion-specific datasets, ensuring high accuracy with minimal data.
Scalable API: Built a Flask-based API to handle real-time image and text input, delivering low-latency, personalized recommendations.
Technologies Used
Deep Learning: EfficientNet (CNN), Vision Transformers (ViT), ResNet-18, RoBERTa (NLP)
Machine Learning: Transfer learning, Data augmentation, Model optimization
Programming Languages: Python
Frameworks & Libraries: TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch, Flask
Data Visualization: Tableau (for visualizing output)

Project Overview
EfficientNet is used for skin tone classification.
Vision Transformers (ViT) and ResNet-18 are employed for face shape and neckline recognition.
RoBERTa is utilized for occasion-based text classification to further personalize the suggestions.
The recommendation engine is rule-based, with a focus on providing a mix of traditional and modern jewelry options based on the extracted features.
